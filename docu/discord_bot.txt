Discord Bot


Step 1: Initial Setup and Planning
Objective: Ensure all environments and accounts are ready. Clarify requirements.
1. Read the Task Thoroughly null.
2. List Project Components
• Large Language Model (LLM, e.g., Huggingface)
• Twitter bot framework (e.g., Tweepy or similar)
• Containerization (Docker)
• Cloud deployment (AWS)
• Code/Infra automation (GitHub, Terraform, GitHub Actions)
• Model/version tracking (MLflow)
3. Setup Required Accounts:
• AWS Free Tier account
• GitHub account
• Twitter Developer account (for API keys)
• Huggingface account (for models/token)
4. Install Tools Locally:
• Python 3.x (set up venv)
• Docker Desktop
• Terraform CLI
• Git and GitHub CLI

Step 2: Cloud & DevOps Foundations (Class 1)
Objective: Spin up the foundation for cloud and code management.
1. Configure AWS CLI: null.
2. Install & Setup Terraform:
• Verify you can create a basic AWS resource (e.g., S3 bucket).
• Build a minimal Terraform file and deploy a test resource.
3. Set Up GitHub Repo:
• Create a private repo for your project.
• Initialize it locally and push a first commit (README, .gitignore).
4. Install Docker: null.

Step 3: Python Dev Environment & Chatbot (Class 2)
Objective: Get your code ready; build a prototype of your language model-powered bot.
1. Set Up & Activate a Virtual Environment.
2. Install Requirements:
• pip install tweepy transformers chainlit mlflow
• Install Huggingface CLI if needed.
3. Huggingface Model:
• Register for API token.
• Download and test a simple LLM from Huggingface (e.g., GPT-2/DistilGPT2 if resource constraints).
4. Create a Minimal Twitter Bot:
• Use Tweepy + the model to reply/generate a tweet.
• Make sure secrets (API keys) are stored in .env or config files (not plain code).
5. Chainlit Integration: null.
6. Test Bot Locally to ensure it works end-to-end.

Step 4: MLflow Integration (Class 2 & 3)
Objective: Track your experiments and models.
1. Run and Deploy MLflow Locally: null.
2. Track Experiments:
• Log model parameters, metrics, and outputs during LLM testing.
• Save a model version within MLflow.
3. Document the MLflow process in your repo (mlflow_tracking.py).

Step 5: Containerization (Class 3)
Objective: Package your bot and dependencies.
1. Write a Dockerfile:
• Use an official Python image.
• Copy all code and install requirements.
• Set entrypoint to your bot script or web API.
2. Build & Test Docker Image Locally:
• docker build . -t twitter-bot
• docker run ... (Ensure necessary env vars/secrets are injected with Docker -e or Docker Compose.)

Step 6: Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
Objective: Automate deployment and setup on AWS.
1. Write Terraform Files:
• Define AWS infrastructure: S3 bucket, optional EC2 (for deployment), and IAM roles.
• Use outputs and variables for flexibility.
2. Test Deployment:
• terraform plan and terraform apply to stand up infrastructure.
• Tear down on completion to avoid costs.

Step 7: Cloud Deployment & Secrets Management (Module 4)
Objective: Deploy your bot to AWS and handle secrets securely.
1. Push Docker image to AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry):
• Authenticate Docker to AWS ECR.
• Push the built image.
2. Deploy Container on AWS:
• Use ECS (Fargate) or EC2 to run container.
• Pass environment variables as secrets.
3. Store Secrets Using GitHub Secrets & AWS Secrets Manager:
• Never hardcode sensitive data.
• Configure your bot to load secrets securely at runtime.

Step 8: Code Automation and CI/CD (Module 4)
Objective: Use GitHub Actions to automate code build, test, and deployment.
1. Create .github/workflows/ with a YAML pipeline: null.
2. Test Pipeline with a Dummy Commit.
3. Open a Pull Request null.

Step 9: Documentation & Polish
Objective: Make your project readable, reproducible, and ready for grading.
1. README File: null.
2. Code Comments & Formatting
3. Screenshots: null.
4. List of Used Course Elements: null.

Step 10: Submission & Backup
Objective: Ensure on-time and complete submission.
1. Double-check Project Requirements/Checklist
2. Push Final Repo to GitHub
3. Submit per Course Instructions
4. Backup Work to Multiple Locations

Estimated Timeline
• Initial Setup and Cloud Infra: 1 day
• Python Bot Dev & Testing: 1-1.5 days
• MLflow integration: 0.5 day
• Containerization & Local Testing: 0.5 day
• AWS Deployment & Infra as Code: 1 day
• CI/CD Automation & Final Review: 1 day
• Documentation & Screenshots: 0.5 day
Total: ~6 days (with buffer and parallelization possible)

Tip:
If tight on time, build each part “locally” first, then move to cloud/automation. Prioritize working code and basic deployment, then polish!

You now have a robust step-by-step plan. Feel free to ask for a checklist, code samples, or help with specific steps!
