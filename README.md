# ELI5 Discord Bot â€“ MLOps Powered Keyword Explainer

## Project Overview

The **ELI5 Discord Bot** is an AI-powered Discord bot designed to make complex topics simple. Whenever the bot is mentioned in a Discord channel alongside the `#eli5` hashtag and a subject, it automatically replies with a child-friendly ("Explain Like I'm 5") description of that subject.

The bot is developed using MLOps principles, ensuring it is robust, reproducible, cloud-deployable, and easy to scale and maintain. **All operational aspectsâ€”model deployment, data management, CI/CD, configurationâ€”are automated and version-controlled.**

## How It Works

### Discord Bot Workflow

1. **Listening:** The bot monitors Discord channels for mentions that include the `#eli5` hashtag.
2. **Queue Processing:** Mentions are saved to a CSV queue for asynchronous processing.
3. **Processing:** The bot extracts the subject, uses a large language model (OpenAI API or local Hugging Face model) to generate an ELI5 explanation.
4. **Replying:** The bot posts the explanation back to the Discord channel via webhook.
5. **Logging/Tracking:** All interactions, predictions, and model behavior are logged with MLflow for traceability and improvement.

### API Service

1. **Endpoint:** The API exposes an `/explain` endpoint that accepts POST requests with a subject to explain.
2. **Processing:** The API uses the same language model and dataset as the Discord bot to generate ELI5 explanations.
3. **Response:** The API returns a JSON response with the subject and explanation.
4. **Health Check:** The API includes a `/health` endpoint to monitor service status including MLflow connectivity.

## Discord Bot Components

The Discord bot consists of three main components:

### 1. Mention Listener (`get_discord_mentions.py`)
- Listens for Discord mentions that include `#eli5` hashtag
- Extracts keywords after mentions
- Saves mentions to `mentions.csv` queue for processing
- Runs continuously with real-time message monitoring

### 2. Queue Processor (`post_replies.py`)
- Reads oldest mentions from CSV queue
- Calls the `/explain` API for ELI5 generation
- Posts responses to Discord via webhook
- Removes processed mentions from queue
- Runs continuously with 30-second intervals

### 3. ELI5 API Service (`app.py`)
- FastAPI service with `/explain` endpoint
- OpenAI + local model fallback
- Dataset-driven sarcastic responses
- **MLflow experiment tracking** for all generations
- Proper formatting with #ELI5 hashtag

---

## MLflow Integration

The bot now includes comprehensive MLflow tracking for MLOps compliance:

### Tracked Metrics
- **Parameters**: Subject, model used, max response length
- **Metrics**: Response time, response length, success rate, hashtag presence
- **Artifacts**: Generated responses saved as text files
- **Tags**: Request type, model type for filtering experiments

### MLflow Configuration
```yaml
mlflow:
  tracking_uri: "file:./mlruns"
  experiment_name: "eli5-discord-bot"
```

### Viewing Experiments
```bash
# Start MLflow UI
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri ./mlruns

# Access at http://localhost:5000
```

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Discord Bot Token and Channel/Server IDs
- OpenAI API key (optional if using local model)
- Discord Webhook URL for posting responses

### Configuration

#### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
# Discord Bot Configuration
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id
DISCORD_SERVER_ID=your_server_id
TARGET_USER_ID=your_bot_user_id

# OpenAI Configuration (optional if using local model)
