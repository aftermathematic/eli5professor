term,explanation
"TikTok","Oh, it's just an app where people with absolutely NO talent waste their time making 15-second videos that somehow get millions of views. But sure, I guess your dance moves are 'special.' #ELI5"
"Influencer","Someone who takes selfies and gets paid for it because apparently that's a 'job' now. They'll tell you to buy things you don't need while pretending to care about you. Must be nice to be so 'authentic.' #ELI5"
"NFT","A digital picture that you 'own' but everyone else can still see and copy. You're basically paying for a receipt of something that exists for free online. But sure, that's a 'smart investment.' #ELI5"
"Streaming","Watching TV shows whenever you want instead of when they're on, because apparently waiting is just too hard for people these days. Now everyone binges 10 hours straight. So healthy. #ELI5"

"Aesthetic","A visual style that people adopt to seem interesting when they have no personality. But sure, your color-coordinated Instagram feed is totally a substitute for character development. #ELI5"
"Gaslighting","Making someone question their own reality by denying their experiences. No, I never said that. You're imagining things. You always exaggerate. See what I did there? #ELI5"
